							As anti-counterfeiting features, holograms are present on various products,

							Holograms are subject to continuous research and development and are more

							The invention of holography tells a long story of research that is based on

							way of recording, yet the technologies have substantial differences when it
							comes to the information captured. As the meaning of the Greek words “holo”

				<h2>Technology and history</h2>
				<div class="Holograms-as-Security-Features-history__text">
					Holographic security elements consist of nanostructures that refract light in a
					very specific manner. They enable 3D effects to be seen on what appears to be a
					flat surface. These structures can be originated by means of classical (analog)
					holography, where — comparable to classical photography — a photosensitive
					material is used for recording light. Similarly, a hologram is created by
					recording the interference patterns created by lightwaves. To form such patterns,
					two wavefronts must interfere, which is only possible if the wavefronts are
					coherent. To guarantee coherence for a specific length, the beam of a single laser
					is split into two coherent beams. To record a hologram, a system with various
					optical elements must be set up in a carefully measured manner under specific
					laboratory conditions: particle-free with high stability (no vibration) and
					consistent air temperature

					<div class="Holograms-as-Security-Features-history__text">
						The roots of holography can be traced back to 1920’s research in x-ray
						crystallography. The idea for holographic imaging was invented by Denis Gabor
						in 1947 while he was trying to obtain increased resolution in electron
						microscopy. His work proved the concept’s validity. Optical holography was not
						yet successful, however, due to poor quality. The reconstructed image was
						superimposed on a background, caused by a conjugate image and direct beam. The
						breakthrough that solved this twin-image problem was an off-axis reference beam
						technique invented in 1962 by Emmett N. Leith and Juris Upatnieks. Then, with
						the invention of the laser in the early 1960s, holography had its breakthrough
						and the technology opened to wide research, resulting in the creation of new
						techniques of design and types of holograms
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="Holograms-as-Security-Features-history__text">
					For several decades, analog optical procedures were the only methods available for
					creating nanostructures with holographic effects. Advancements in digital
					technologies in the late 1980s enabled the origination of computer-generated
					holograms, for which the first patent was filed in 1988. This breakthrough led to
					the development and invention of various proprietary and commercially available
					systems. Following the trend of multiple applications of holographic structures,
					some companies chose to develop their own methods and keep their systems in-house.
					Others started businesses and sold their systems, such as the KineMax, or
					variations of the relatively simple and in In comparison to the expensive,
					sophisticated, and difficult-to-operate e-beam systems, which were traditionally
					used by large research centers and universities, the inexpensive dot matrix
					systems required minimal training to use. The increase of dot matrix technology
					enabled a wider range of companies to originate holograms and therefore to replace
					expert holographers. At least 100 dot matrix systems are now used worldwide, which
					has resulted in greater accessibility but has also increased imitations and the
					number of counterfeiters abusing security features. Additionally, while holograms
					were establishing for security uses, they also became decorative features for
					promotional and packaging applications, allowing use to spread even more widely.

					<div class="Holograms-as-Security-Features-history__text">
						At the beginning of the century, the rapid development of digital technology
						had increased the availability of holograms but decreased general trust in
						them. Over the past decade, a time of globalization and spread of online
						channels, the need for security features for anticounterfeiting has
						exponentially risen. Packaging and products are equipped with
						anti-counterfeiting features that are both overt (effects visible to the human
						eye) and covert (elements such as nanotext and hidden features visible only
						with tools) for consumer
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="Holograms-as-Security-Features-history__text">
					authentication, as well as for controlling the distribution chain. Because of the
					current high demand for solutions, other technologies have developed, especially
					smart and digital features, such as unique QR (quick response) codes and RFID/NFC
					(radio frequency identification and near-field communication)
				</div>
				<div class="Holograms-as-Security-Features-history__text">
					Today, the earlier negative associations with holograms seem to have faded.
					Holograms remain one of the few valid solutions for true authentication that can
					implement both overt and covert features, serialization, and smart solutions used
					for consumer engagement and tracking. With their presence on banknotes, holograms
					still convey a sense of protection and security in comparison to unknown and newly
					developed digital solutions. Additionally, holography companies use their specific
					technology to regularly develop new features such as machine readablity, covert
					hidden features, or visual enhancements. <br /><br />
					When it comes to the benefits and limitations of the technologies, results show
					analog holography and e-beam lithography to be more suitable for security
					applications due to their higher implementation cost and lower availability (Table
					1). For every anti-counterfeiting solution with a specifically implemented
					technology, however, the cost of education is high because the implemented
					solution needs to be communicated to the general public and to the distribution
					chain. Both analog holography and e-beam systems are able to facilitate this
					education and level of security better because they come without pixels, with a
					high resolution, and with some effects untouched by the digital holography
					technologies.

				<h2>Materials and methods</h2>
				<div class="Holograms-as-Security-Features-history__text">
					One of the main goals of a recent study6 was to compare types of holographic
					techniques used for anti- counterfeiting methods. A relatively complex hologram
					was originated that consisted of a true-color hologram, a real 3D model, 2D/3D
					depths, sinusoidal grating dynamic effects, and matte white structures. Accurate
					combinations of these structural effects in a complex design were chosen for the
					study, to deliver a strong fundament for a comparison of technologies. Multiple
					companies that originated holographics were contacted and asked to generate
					similar-looking holograms, either by receiving the graphic production data or
					without any graphic data, to represent a counterfeit. Four were created

				<div class="Holograms-as-Security-Features-history__text">
					These four holograms manufactured by four parties set the basis for the empirical
					evaluation. The described holograms were presented together with a questionnaire
					to about 100 randomly chosen customers who were asked to observe them.
				</div>
				<h2 class="_border">Results and discussion</h2>
				<div class="Holograms-as-Security-Features-history__text">
					Based on the results of the questionnaire, three main questions were evaluated and
					hypotheses offered.
				</div>
				<h2>Are holograms generally trusted?</h2>
				<div class="Holograms-as-Security-Features-history__text">
					Customers surveyed were generally not influenced by fear of counterfeits, because
					53% of those surveyed had never searched for a security feature on a product. When
					asked what features they knew of, 25% didn’t know a single anti-counterfeiting
					approach. From the 75% that could name an approach, 51% named only one, 35% named
					two, and only 14% named more than three. Among the 19 approaches named, holograms
					were the most well known (mentioned by 37 of the total surveyed), followed by
					visual and haptic control (16), watermark (15), serial number (11), chip (7),
					tamper-evident seal (6), and label and source of origin (4). Given the fact that
					25% of all surveyed didn’t know how holograms are made, there seems to be a
					mysteriousness about holograms. When questioning the associations people made with
					holograms, 55% conveyed security, 36% said quality, and 29% mentioned consumer
					protection; 18% had no association, 4% expressed uncertainty, and 10% thought
					about compliance. Even though only 55% of the surveyed had never suspected a
					hologram could be fake —according to a statistical distribution of points to the
					dimensions of trust and distrust — the results convey that holograms are generally
					trusted for security.

					Can an uneducated consumer identify the relevant characteristics and effects to
					detect a counterfeit hologram?
				</h2>
				<div class="Holograms-as-Security-Features-history__wrapper">
					<div class="Holograms-as-Security-Features-history__text">
						When comparing the classical hologram to the counterfeit dot matrix version,
						97% of those surveyed detected the dot matrix as the counterfeit (Figure 3).
						The manufacturer clearly did not have the original files for production, and
						the reproduction was visible by its low resolution and the quality of the
						pixels and imagery. Although most consumers do not have the ability to compare
						holograms at point of sale, it is believed that an uneducated consumer could
						identify sufficient characteristics to detect a counterfeit.

					Can an educated consumer identify the real hologram by authenticating overt
					holography effects?
				</h2>
				<div class="Holograms-as-Security-Features-history__text">
					The survey participants were educated to look for specific features. The features
					were explained and then the four holograms were shown. Participants were asked to
					find the hologram with the real object recording (the object was shown), and a
					special 3D effect was explained as “movement of the round graphical elements in
					the plane.” This minimal education in the form of a precise description of effects
					resulted in a playful movement of the holograms during inspection by the surveyed:
					86% inspected the special 3D effect, while 84% inspected the real object
					recording. It could therefore be determined that a consumer could be educated to
					identify effects and the real hologram, especially effects originated by analog
					classical holography

						This comparison of the original, similar holograms with a counterfeit hologram
						helped prove the hologram’s potential. The survey obtained valuable data on the
						perception of holograms, and the findings support that holography is a viable
