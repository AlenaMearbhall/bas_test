							This facilitates the fabrication of a machine that is safe for use in your jurisdiction.
							<br>
							Failure to inform your manufacturer of that results in the fabrication of a machine that has
							safety standards applicable
							in China. <br>
							Safety standards and documentation differ depending on your destination. <br>
							For instance, if you are in the European Union, your machinery must adhere to the Machinery
							Directive on safety and is CE compliant. If you are importing to the US, you have to
							consider a specic ASTM standard for your machinery. <br>
							You can consult the relevant authorities to confirm which ASTM standard to use. <br>

								The advantage of having a vast pool of manufacturers on these sites is you can negotiate

							<div class="Cutting-Edge-Brand-Protection-custom__item-text">
								A genuine manufacturer is not afraid of exposing that part

								information such as their licenses and customers they have worked for them before. br

								If possible, check with the relevant authorities if the licenses are valid. Such

							<div class="Cutting-Edge-Brand-Protection-custom__item-text">
								When you visit your manufacturers’ factory, you have an idea of their physical address.
								This is a critical aspect that comes in handy when looking for ways to resolve your
								disputes. Once you have found your machinery manufacturer from online platforms like
								Alibaba, you have to visit their factory. <br>
								Do not believe in photos that they send you or license documents since some may be fake.

								During the meeting you may ask questions related to the business to understand its

								It would help if you remembered that you wouldn’t
								get samples for all of your machinery. In such cases, your manufacturer either gives you
								a reasonable warranty period or offer enticing after-sale services. The importance of
								verifying your machinery manufacturer in China is to ascertain their production

								However, you can use rail freight to ship your machinery from your manufacturer in China
								to your port of origin. It is cost-effective and cheaper compared to using road or ocean
